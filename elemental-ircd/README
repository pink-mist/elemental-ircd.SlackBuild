Elemental-IRCd is a high performance, lightweight, and scalable IRC daemon. It
is a fork of the now-defunct ShadowIRCD and seeks to continue in the direction
ShadowIRCD was headed.

An `/etc/rc.d/rc.elemental-ircd` script is supplied which supports
start/stop/restart, which you can call from your rc.local:

    # /etc/rc.d/rc.local
    # ==================
    if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.elemental-ircd ]; then
        /etc/rc.d/rc.elemental-ircd start
    fi

Note: elemental-ircd comes with a binary called `/usr/bin/mkpasswd`, but this
conflicts with `/usr/bin/mkpasswd` from expect, so the `mkpasswd` supplied by
elemental-ircd is renamed to `ircd-mkpasswd` by the SlackBuild script.
